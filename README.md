# Web-Socket-Animated-HTML5-Canvas

Motivation:
Made for use by GSU as part of Master's project.  Intentionally made more interesting by use of sockets and infinite data generation instead of a request to the server and a set amount of data.

Aim:
Use a JavaScript web socket to a Java server to animate the HTML5 Canvas with random points

Use:
To run without the research packages, remove all references to the Boids objects and replace with other data generation tools.
